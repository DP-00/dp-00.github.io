            <p> Passion for maps, data analysis, environment and traveling has resulted in choosing Geoinformatics 
                as a field of my development. For a couple of years I have been eager to learn new technologies 
                that enable me to create modern geospatial products with implications in the  real world. 
                Some of the presented projects were created as a part of assignments during my studies, 
                while the others are for my personal use. Below there is also a set of certificates that presents process 
                of my development over the years. My goal for the future is to not only use available solutions, 
                but also to contribute to the geospatial community with my own ideas.

                    <p>As my Bachelor project I decided to develop a web application for customized travel archiving and planning using <b>OpenLayers</b> and it's extensions. 
                    The app could be used for scientific and geographical excursions as well as monitoring and analyzing the movements of selected animals. 
                    The application is aimed at people who are at least a little familiar with GIS 
                    and who are willing to spend some time creating a personalized environment to manage data more efficiently 
                    in the long term and automate recurring actions. The project will be completed at the beginning of 2023.</p>

                    <p>Using  recorded <b>GPS Track</b> and photos from the journey I visualized memories from the great road trip across Norway. 
                        Map was created using <b>Mapbox GL JS </b>and <b>Turf.js</b> libraries with data imported from <b>GeoJSON </b>file 
                        that contains coordinates of taken photos, name of the place and a file name. 
                        Rendered track is updated in real-time as it was suggested in 
                        <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/live-update-feature"> this Mapbox example</a>. </p>
                    <p>
                        I used Turf function that returns the closest point on the line to show images at the moment the path gets closer. 
                        Before visualization process there is a new GeoJSON created that contains corresponding point 
                        on the GPS Track and information about real point. Once the path is being rendered there is a comparison 
                        if there is any new photo to display on the way. During presentation it is also possible to adjust map zoom level 
                        and position if you want to explore some places in details. Pins that are created along the way enable to open pop-up 
                        that shows picturesque places along the road that were presented before.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy making maps both to show the road that is ahead of me in order to plan it 
                        and also the one already travelled in order to have the memories recorded. 
                        While on the previous slides I presented GPS track visualization using Mapbox after completed journey,  
                        here is the map I used in order to plan this trip. It was created using <b>QGIS</b>, where you can specify basemap, 
                        symbolization based on the properties of your dataset and labels. 
                        It is possible to present several “maps” on one “print” 
                        and here it was used to show details of hikes on the way on the left sidebar. 
                        The map includes information about route duration, hiking trails, attractions, ferries 
                        as well as possible accommodation on the way. </p>

                            The city offers many places to explore! Check the map to see where you can go from our renting points.

                    <p>Presented map was created using OpenLayers library as a part of a website for a bike rental company during 
                        Web technologies and Application Development courses. As it was during my exchange when I did not 
                        have geoinformatics part included in my studies, I wanted to add it myself by creating this interactive map. 
                        Using it, potential customer can explore places near rental points and might want to start the journey as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>Path Explorer is a first-person puzzle video game requiring spatial recognition skill to solve those challenges. 
                        Open world enables exploration of the best places from Møre og Romsdal region (Norwegian county), where the action takes place. 
                        The terrain used in the game presents real world data as it was implemented using <b>Mapbox Maps SDK for Unity</b>. 
                        Various <b>3D model maps</b> are waiting in set points. 
                        They will show the place where the user is standing right now and the next destination. 
                        The task is to remember where the place is and be able to navigate to it. 
                        During the journey, distances will get longer and there will be more obstacles on the way. </p>
                    <p> The game was developed using <b>Unity</b>, with <b>C# scripts</b> for behaviors. 
                        Logo and UI elements were created in <b>SketchBook</b> - raster graphics software from Autodesk. 
                        Small terrain model and the first level maps texture were created in Blender. Contours textures were developed in <b>QGIS</b>. 
                        The game was developed individually as a final project for a Game Development course during my student exchange to Norway. 
                        I wanted to create a geospatial game for everyone regardless of their previous gaming experience. 
                        The idea emerged after noticing that many people struggle to go around the terrain or using maps these days. 
                        I think that this skill is very useful and learning it in the Norwegian scenery might be a very pleasant experience. </p>

                    <p>I believe that insightful spatial visualization can be very helpful to understand many environmental problems, 
                        so in the future they are possible to solve. This is the way I wanted to get involved in the university project, 
                        beside my main study course, that aimed to understand the problem of waste on the Norwegian coastline. 
                        Using <b>PowerBI</b> together with one other student we processed real-world data accumulated through several years 
                        and presented it on interactive charts with maps. It was later shown in the meeting with people 
                        from environmental organizations that were trying to tackle this issue.</p>

            <h2>Certificates</h2>
            <p>As a part of my self-directed learning, 
                from the very beginning of my studies I have taken many online courses such as the Esri MOOCs, 
                Python courses on Kaggle and NASA webinars that enable me to constantly broaden my knowledge 
                and learn specialized English vocabulary. Their duration varies from an hour to several weeks as in the case of MOOCs. 
                All of them had a practical part where you either had to create small projects or solve short tasks connected to their topic.
                Those training enhanced my knowledge in fields like Web Application development (also geospatial one), 
                Remote Sensing and Image processing, Python programming as well as geospatial data analysis, processing and visualization.</p>
